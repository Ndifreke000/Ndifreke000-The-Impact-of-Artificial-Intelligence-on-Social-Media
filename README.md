# Good, Bad, Ugly: AI and Social Media Analysis

This project explores the categorization of social media content into three categories: "The Good" (User Engagement and Content Personalization), "The Bad" (Privacy Concerns), and "The Evil" (Misinformation and Hate Speech). It employs various machine learning models to classify the tweets into these categories.

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify social media content into three distinct categories:
1. **The Good**: User engagement and content personalization.
2. **The Bad**: Privacy concerns.
3. **The Evil**: Misinformation and hate speech.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/good-bad-ugly.git
cd good-bad-ugly
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled tweets, with the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- `label`: Label indicating the category (0 for "Good", 1 for "Bad", 2 for "Evil").
- `tweet`: The text of the tweet.

## Data Loading and Initial Analysis

The initial step involves loading the data and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA). This helps in understanding the distribution of data and identifying any patterns or anomalies.

## Data Preprocessing

The tweets are cleaned by removing URLs, non-alphanumeric characters, and stopwords. Tokenization is performed to break the text into individual words. Class imbalance is handled using techniques such as oversampling.

## Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are created to convert the text data into numerical form, which is required for training machine learning models. Techniques such as Word2Vec or TF-IDF are used for this purpose.

## Model Architecture for Each Category

### User Engagement and Content Personalization Model ("The Good")

A machine learning model, such as a RandomForest, is used to classify tweets related to user engagement and content personalization. Feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF are employed to convert text data into numerical features.

### Privacy Concern Model ("The Bad")

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is used to classify tweets that indicate privacy concerns. The sequential nature of LSTM helps in capturing the context and temporal dependencies in the text data.

### Misinformation and Hate Speech Model ("The Evil")

Another LSTM model is used to classify tweets containing misinformation and hate speech. The model is trained to identify patterns and contextual cues that are indicative of harmful content.

## Training and Evaluation

The models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. Cross-validation is performed to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data.

## Results

The results of the classification models are reported, including the accuracy and F1 score for each category. Insights and conclusions are drawn based on the performance of the models and the effectiveness of the categorization.
